## Fundamentals

### Declaring variables 
```
s := "" - It may be used only within a function, not for package-level variables
var s string  - This form relies on default initialization to the zero value for strings, which is ""
var s = ""  - 
var s string = ""
```
In practice, you should generally
use one of the first two forms, with explicit initialization to say that the initial value isimportant and implicit initialization to say that the initial value doesnâ€™t matter.

## Syntax 

#### Function naming convention

Exported Methods: If a method name starts with a capital letter, it means the method is exported from the package and can be accessed by code outside of the package where it is defined.

Unexported Methods: If a method name starts with a lowercase letter, it means the method is unexported, and it is only accessible within the package where it is defined.
